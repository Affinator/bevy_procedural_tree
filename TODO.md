# Rough sketch:
    - create showroom 
    - create single tree
    - Try to modify existing tree instead of regenerating everything
    - Implement "growing"
    - allow creating multiple trees
    - allow managing tree generation

# Misc:
- resolution (LOD) of meshes should be flexible
    - regen the meshes if the desired resolution changes
